# daily-planner

## NAME
The name of this webpage is Daily Planner.

## DESCRIPTION
This webpage is designed to display a daily 9-5 schedule that allows you to place events in each hour block, and save them to allow for the data to persist on webpage reload. Additionally, each hour block will be dynamically displayed in relation to the current time. If the current time is 11am, then the 9am and 10am hour blocks will be greyed out to display past hour blocks, the 11am hour block will be red to display the current hour, and the 12pm-5pm hour blocks will be green to display future hour blocks. 

## PROGRAMS USED
I used HTML and CSS to create the header and nav contents of this webpage and javascript (specifically Jquery) to create the daily planner content. Git/Github were used as version control and deployed to Github Pages.

## INSTALLATION
